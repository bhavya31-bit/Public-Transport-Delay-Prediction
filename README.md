# Public-Transport-Delay-Prediction
This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict public bus delays using historical transport data. A Random Forest regression model is trained on user-observable features such as route, day, time (hour), and service gap (min gap) to ensure realistic and leakage-free predictions.
