# 🚌 Public Transport Delay Prediction System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **machine learning–based public transport delay prediction system** using historical bus operation data. A **Random Forest Regressor** is trained to predict the expected delay (in minutes) based on observable features such as route, day, hour, and service gap.

An interactive **Gradio web application** is included to allow users to make real-time delay predictions.
